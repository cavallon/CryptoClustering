# CryptoClustering

# Summary:

This project involves using Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. After preparing the data, including normalization and PCA, the analysis includes finding the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and then clustering the cryptocurrencies using K-means. Finally, the results are visualized and compared to understand the impact of using fewer features in clustering.

The final code file is enclosed in the "Starter Code" folder. The final code file is titled "Crypto_Clustering". 

Please Note: The graphs/charts do not show up when viewing the code in Github. You must load the code into VS Code to view the charts and graphs.
